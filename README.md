## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm a mobile developer with a strong focus on building high-performance apps that not only deliver a smooth user experience but are also backed by actionable performance insights. My work centers around optimizing app responsiveness, reducing load times, and ensuring stability across different devices and platforms.

In todayâ€™s fast-paced digital environment, performance isnâ€™t just a nice-to-haveâ€”itâ€™s a core part of user satisfaction and retention. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m passionate about digging into performance bottlenecks, refining code, and integrating tools that help track critical metrics such as app startup time, frame rates, memory usage, and crash rates. Whether itâ€™s through native development or cross-platform frameworks, I prioritize performance as a first-class feature.

This repository is a collection of my projects, experiments, and utilities related to app optimization and metrics tracking. It includes sample implementations, performance testing setups, and best practices Iâ€™ve learned along the way. I often work with tools like Firebase Performance Monitoring, Flipper, Android Profiler, Xcode Instruments, and custom logging solutions to gain deep insights into app behavior in real-world scenarios.

If you're a fellow developer looking to level up your appâ€™s performance or just exploring how to make your mobile experiences more efficient and data-driven, feel free to browse through the code, ask questions, or contribute. I believe in sharing knowledge and building better apps together.

Thanks for stopping by! I hope the work shared here can help you in your own development journey toward faster, more reliable mobile applications.
